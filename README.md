# phyzzie

This library simulates simple physical 2D worlds defined by json files.
Simulations may be run programatically using nodejs at accelerated speed or
rendered in the browser in real time.

### Oops

Unfortunately, the version of Box2D used by this version of phyzzie (box2dweb)
may be non-free because it may have been generated with a transpiler that is
either non-free, or not widely available. For this reason, you shouldn't use
this version of phyzzie. That dependency is not included in this repository and
has already been replaced with free software in the most recent version of
phyzzie.
